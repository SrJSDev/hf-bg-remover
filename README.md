# hf-bg-remover

Leverage Hugging Face AI model [`briaai/RMBG-1.4`](https://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-1.4) for image background removal in Node.js.

Saves the result as PNG, and optionally a compressed PNG and WEBP. This will keep the transparency of the image background.

- required Option: `-i, --input {input}`
  - Input URL, or filepath, or glob*
- required Option: `-o, --output {output}`
  - Output filepath, or folder (if glob*)
- option: `-p, --png`
  - Copy/compress to PNG
  - Note: PNG compression is a WIP. It requires the `pngquant` binary to be installed, and its config is manual atm. üõë
